## Employment History

### March 2018 - present: Tech Lead / Architect, MADE.com

* Leading small teams, responsible for architecture, planning, design and delivery of critical projects for the logistics side of the business
* Eg: an event-sourced microservice to integrate with an external returns service via their API
* A project to migrate critical logistics functionality out of an existing system, while keeping the lights on, using event-driven architecture, asyncio, 
* Built the first user-facing app backed by analytics data in BigQuery with a React frontend.
* Launched several initiatives around continuous delivery / agile ways of working:  pair programming, rollback strategy, continuous delivery, trunk-based development, feature flags...
* Lots of devops/infrastructure work:  improving automated deployment tools, increasing observability/monitoring, debugging production issues. 
* Led internal training efforts:  fortnightly TDD katas, weekly code challenges, conference trips, coding workshops for the wider business, etc.
* Mentoring & Coaching junior colleagues.

### 2009 - 2018: Software developer, PythonAnywhere.com (a Python PaaS)

* Joined as a 4-person startup was spun off from a previous business
* Saw it through from initial idea, via pivots, to a profitable business.
* Extreme Programming (XP): Rigorous TDD. Pair programming 80% of the time.
* Substantial experience building & managing infrastructure, administering servers, containerization, security, etc.
* Helped evolve the frontend through jQuery, Angular, React; handrolled CSS to Bootstrap.
* Customer support, marketing, devrel.

### 2007-2009: Freelance projects

* Taught myself Python & web dev (this was while I was studying for my second degree)
* Helped a small business transition from spreadsheets to a database-driven web app.

### 2004-2007: Management Consultant, Qedis.

* "Big 4" style management consulting focused on the CTO
* Project management, wide range of clients, lots of business experience, powerpoint, all that good stuff.   But it wasn't techie enough for me.


## Technologies

* Python.  But also commonly Javascript/Typescript, and whatever else comes along (Bash/Lua/Clojure...)
* Postgres, MySQL, BigQuery, EventStoreDB, Redis, CSVs
* Docker, docker-compose, and even hand-rolled containerization with chroot/cgroups/unshare.
* AWS, Kubernetes.  Hashistack (Consul/Nomad/Vault), Ansible & Tower
* ELK stack, Grafana, datadog.
* Ubuntu, Debian, Alpine; Nginx, Apache 

## Specialisms & Interests

* Software architecture & DDD.  Event-driven systems.  CQRS.  At PythonAnywere I helped to build a complex piece of infrastructure from scratch, and I learned about all the layers of the stack.  At MADE I learned about building enterprise software, focused on specific business domains, using microservices and event-driven, asynchronous integration.
* Web dev / fullstack:  I understand cookies, HTTPS certificates, CORS, JWT.  I can set up a React environment (or at least I could last week).  I know the difference between a domain and an IP address, I know what ports are for, I've debugged container port mapping problems, I know my nslookup from my netcat, I've spent my fair share of time debugging CSS issues. I know how to tail a logfile, I know how to ssh into several servers at once with tmux, I know how to switch on devtools and preview a mobile render, I know accessibility is about more than adding alt tags to your images.
* Testing / TDD: I'm passionate about TDD as productivity aid and as a design aid.  I'm always looking for better ways to test things, to shorten feedback cycles, to aim for the perfectly balanced "test pyramid", to make for happier developers and more reliable code.
* Writing beautiful, idiomatic, maintainable code.  Finding the right balance between elegance, expressiveness and simplicity.  I'm _almost_ obsessive about it.
* Continuous delivery, devops, microservices, migrating functionality from legacy services.  How you get things into production is as important as how you build them.
* Coaching & Mentoring.  I love pairing, I love talking to people about their career ambitions, I love helping them to find their way towards work they're interested in, I love teaching and helping people learn.


## Outside of work

I've been a video producer (and roadie) for a touring opera company. I'm an active member of the UK and worldwide Python communities, and often speak at conferences. I used to swing dance, until we had kids. I was the press officer for Pirate Party UK for about 6 months. I've done two small stand-up comedy gigs. I can quote the film Aliens from start to finish. I am a massive coffee nerd (snob?). I grew up in France so I am bilingual English/French. I also lived in Italy for a couple of years so I have fluent Italian. Ciao. I have two small children.  They are nice.
